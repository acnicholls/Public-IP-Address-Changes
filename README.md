Public IP Address Changes Alert – PowerShell

Receive an email notification every time your Public IP Address changes. The Public IP Address Check script is a free and easy to use PowerShell script that can be ran as a schedule task using Task Scheduler within Windows.

Why would I use this?
Most Public IP Addresses for home broadband connections are normally dynamic IP Addresses and depending on the ISP they can change frequently. While there are solutions such as Dynamic DNS, In some cases it can’t be used.

This is a quick and easy way to be notified if your IP Address changes, if you need to be notified when your IP address changes as you might be unable to use Dynamic DNS or would prefer not to.
